****** Test << & >> operators ******

Input values for A and B: -1000 -100000000999999999

A = -1000
B = -100000000999999999

****** Test += operator ******

A = -1000
B = -100000000999999999
C = 0

C = B += A

A = -1000
B = -100000001000000999
C = -100000001000000999

****** Test -= operator ******

A = -1000
B = -100000000999999999
C = -100000001000000999

C = B -= A

A = -1000
B = -100000000999998999
C = -100000000999998999

****** Test unary - operator ******

A = -1000
B = -100000000999999999
C = -100000000999998999

C = B = -A

A = -1000
B = 1000
C = 1000

****** Test boolean operators ******

A = -1000
B = -100000000999999999

A != B
A > B
A >= B
B < A
B <= A
A is not equal to 0
B is not equal to 0

****** Test increment and decrement operators ******

A = -1000
B = -100000000999999999

cout << A++ << A
-1000  -999

cout << B-- << B
-100000000999999999  -100000001000000000

cout << ++A << A
-998  -998

cout << --B << B
-100000001000000001  -100000001000000001

****** Test overloaded type cast to double operator ******

A = -998
B = -100000001000000001

A cast to a double is: -998
B cast to a double is: -1e+17
