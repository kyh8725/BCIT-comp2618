****** Test << & >> operators ******

Input values for A and B: 0 0\

A = 0
B = 0

****** Test += operator ******

A = 0
B = 0
C = 0

C = B += A

A = 0
B = 0
C = 0

****** Test -= operator ******

A = 0
B = 0
C = 0

C = B -= A

A = 0
B = 0
C = 0

****** Test unary - operator ******

A = 0
B = 0
C = 0

C = B = -A

A = 0
B = 0
C = 0

****** Test boolean operators ******

A = 0
B = 0

A != B
A > B
A >= B
B < A
B <= A
A is equal to 0
B is equal to 0

****** Test increment and decrement operators ******

A = 0
B = 0

cout << A++ << A
0  1

cout << B-- << B
0  -1

cout << ++A << A
2  2

cout << --B << B
-2  -2

****** Test overloaded type cast to double operator ******

A = 2
B = -2
