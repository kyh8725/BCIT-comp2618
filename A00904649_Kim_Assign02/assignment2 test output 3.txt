****** Test << & >> operators ******

Input values for A and B: -100000001 -10000000000009999

A = -100000001
B = -10000000000009999

****** Test += operator ******

A = -100000001
B = -10000000000009999
C = 0

C = B += A

A = -100000001
B = -10000000100010000
C = -10000000100010000

****** Test -= operator ******

A = -100000001
B = -10000000000009999
C = -10000000100010000

C = B -= A

A = -100000001
B = -9999999900009998
C = -9999999900009998

****** Test unary - operator ******

A = -100000001
B = -10000000000009999
C = -9999999900009998

C = B = -A

A = -100000001
B = 100000001
C = 100000001

****** Test boolean operators ******

A = -100000001
B = -10000000000009999

A != B
A > B
A >= B
B < A
B <= A
A is not equal to 0
B is not equal to 0

****** Test increment and decrement operators ******

A = -100000001
B = -10000000000009999

cout << A++ << A
-100000001  -100000000

cout << B-- << B
-10000000000009999  -10000000000010000

cout << ++A << A
-99999999  -99999999

cout << --B << B
-10000000000010001  -10000000000010001

****** Test overloaded type cast to double operator ******

A = -99999999
B = -10000000000010001

A cast to a double is: -1e+08
B cast to a double is: -1e+16
